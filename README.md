# Wireless ADXL for Klipper

This is the public release of my wireless ADXL project developed for Klipper resonance testing. I originally built this as a commercial product but due to budget restrictions I could not move it into production. Instead of shelving it, I decided to release everything as open source so the community can benefit from it.
The full project is now available open sourced. Hardware, firmware and host-side tools are included. Anyone is free to use, modify and build on top of it.


If you find the project useful and want to support future work, you can donate here:
